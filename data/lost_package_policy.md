**Lost Package Policy**

### **1. Reporting a Lost Package**
#### **For Senders:**
- A package is considered lost if there is no tracking update for **10 business days (domestic)** or **20 business days (international)**.
- Senders must initiate a claim through the **Postal Service Claims Portal** or by visiting the nearest branch.
- Required documents:
  - Proof of shipment (receipt, tracking number)
  - Invoice or declared value of the package
  - Insurance proof (if applicable)
- Investigation period:
  - Domestic: **5-7 business days**
  - International: **10-15 business days** (may vary by country)

#### **For Receivers:**
- Check tracking updates and confirm the delivery status.
- If marked "delivered" but not received:
  - Check with household members or neighbors.
  - Verify with the local post office.
- If tracking is inactive for the designated period (10-20 business days), request the sender to initiate a claim.

### **2. Compensation & Refund Policy**
#### **For Insured Packages:**
- Standard insurance covers up to **€100 (EU), £85 (UK), and $150 (US)**.
- Additional insurance:
  - **€5 per extra €100 coverage (EU)**
  - **£4 per extra £100 coverage (UK)**
  - **$6 per extra $100 coverage (US)**
- Full refunds provided for lost packages within the insurance limit.
- Processing time: **7-14 business days**.

#### **For Uninsured Packages:**
- Compensation is **not guaranteed** but a claim can still be filed.
- Investigation outcomes determine any possible reimbursement (up to €50/£40/$60 for documented losses).

### **3. Special Considerations**
#### **European Union vs. UK Policy Differences:**
- **EU:** Claims handled under unified postal regulations (e.g., GDPR-compliant claims process).
- **UK:** Claims processed separately under Royal Mail regulations, requiring additional customs documentation.
- Packages valued above **€1,000/£850** require extra verification.

#### **International Delays & Lost Packages**
- Customs delays do **not** qualify as lost packages.
- Delayed packages due to incorrect address information are ineligible for full refunds.
- Unclaimed packages after **30 days** may be returned to the sender (fees apply).

### **4. Filing a Claim**
- Submit a claim within **60 days** of shipment.
- If the package is found, the claim is voided.
- Approved claims are refunded via:
  - Bank transfer
  - Store credit (for partnered retailers)
  - Original payment method (if available)
