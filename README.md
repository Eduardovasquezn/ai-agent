# Building an AI Agentic Workflow for Postal Services with WhatsApp, PostgreSQL, Qdrant, Langfuse, FastAPI

## üìå Overview
Postal services handle countless inquiries daily‚Äîtracking packages, updating user details, and resolving lost package issues. To explore how AI can automate these tasks, this project introduces an **agentic workflow** that makes real-time decisions based on user requests, reducing the burden on call centers and eliminating the frustrations of traditional chatbots.

This system was built **without relying on any frameworks**, using **pure Python**, making it highly flexible and lightweight.

## üî• Features
- **Automated Query Handling**: Dynamically determines how to process each request.
- **Package Tracking**: Retrieves real-time tracking data from PostgreSQL.
- **User Data Updates**: Supports modifying user details, including address and city, with flexibility to update additional fields.
- **Lost Package & Shipping Policies**: Uses **Qdrant** for similarity search, retrieving relevant knowledge base articles.
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Enables users to interact with the system through WhatsApp for real-time support.
- **Conversational Memory**: Maintains context for better user interactions.
- **Observability with Langfuse**: Tracks queries and responses for monitoring and debugging.

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **AI & LLM**: GPT-4o
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Vector Search**: Qdrant
- **API Framework**: FastAPI
- **Messaging**: WhatsApp API via Meta Developer Platform
- **Configuration Management**: Dynaconf
- **Monitoring & Tracing**: Langfuse
- **Deployment Support**: Ngrok for local exposure
